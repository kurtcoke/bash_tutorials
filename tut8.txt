8 - The Init and system scripts.
===============================================================================

In this section I will cover the system V init, which is the most used
init in Linux.
Beside the Syst V inti, there are also the BSD init, which is used by
Slackware and Debian and in some smaller distributions of Linux.
The rest, as far as I know, uses the Syst V init.
There are not so much difference of the two, I'll try to cover the
differences later.
The example and files here are taken from SysVinit-2.78-6 & initscripts-5.27-37
which is compatible in some ways with the BSD init, I'll come back to that
later.

So here we go:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The basic Syst V init comes with the following commands & devices: 

/dev/initctl		This is the init controll device.
/sbin/halt		This is to shut down the system.
/sbin/init		This is to change the init runlevel.
/sbin/killall5		This will kill everything but the script that runs it.
/sbin/pidof		This will get the PID of a Process name.
/sbin/poweroff		This will power down the system.
/sbin/reboot		This will reboot the system.
/sbin/runlevel		This will tell the init runlevel.
/sbin/shutdown		This will shut down the system.
/sbin/sulogin		This is the single user mode login.
/sbin/telinit		This is the init process control initialization.
/usr/bin/last		This shows who was in the system last.
/usr/bin/lastb		This is about the same as last.

/usr/bin/utmpdump	This dumps a file for utmp (this lacks documentation)
/usr/bin/wall		This sends a message to all ttys.

And then the init needs the following extra files/dirs and commands from
the initscripts package:

So what do you really need to know of all that ?

Well, here's the simple basics of how it works and what you need to remember.

The /etc/inittab is already explained.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is how the runlevels works:

The Runlevel can be one of 1 to 6 and the number means this:

0 - halt
1 - Single user mode
2 - Multiuser, without NFS
3 - Full multiuser mode
4 - Unused
5 - X11
6 - reboot

You change the runlevel with the `init` command, so say that you are
int runlevel 3 and you wanna go to single user mode for some reason,
then you can do: init 1
In a single user mode you can only be one user, root.
And in a single user enviorment you can't do networking and
other tasks, the runlevel 1 is meant to be there for system maintenence.

The two mostly used runlevels as default is 3 and 5.
Mandrake and RedHat etc. uses Runlevel 5 as default, and so they
start up with a GUI in X Windows.

Typing init 0 will shut down the system, and typing runlevel 6 will
reboot the system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What determes what the various runlevels actually start at boot time
is what is in there respective directory:

Runlevel 0: /etc/rc.d/rc0.d/
Runlevel 1: /etc/rc.d/rc1.d/
Runlevel 2: /etc/rc.d/rc2.d/
Runlevel 3: /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/
Runlevel 4: /etc/rc.d/rc4.d/
Runlevel 5: /etc/rc.d/rc5.d/
Runlevel 6: /etc/rc.d/rc6.d/

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, here say that you wanna stop your web server from starting at boot time.
The first thing you wanna do is to find out what runlevel you are in, that
you do with the runlevel command like this:

alien:~$ runlevel
N 3
alien:~$

This means that you are in runlevel 3.
So from here go to /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/ which is the directory for runlevel 3.

alien:~$ cd /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/
alien: /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/ $

Here you find the file that starts the webserver (this file is usually
called httpd with a character and a number infront of it (I'll explain the
character and the numbers soon), so list the contents of the current
directory and find it, or just do like this:

alien: /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/ $ ls -l *httpd
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root       15 Dec  5 06:14 S85httpd -> ../init.d/httpd
alien: /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/ $

This says that S85httpd is a link to /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd
(../init.d/ if you're standing in /etc/rc.d/init.d/ mean /etc/rc.d/init.d/)

So just remove the link like this:

alien: /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/ $ rm -f S85httpd
alien: /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/ $

And that's how you stop something from starting with the runlevel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, if you rather would have something more start with the runlevel
at boot time you do like this:

You make a simple script that starts what you wanna have started and
put it in /etc/rc.d/init.d/.
Say that your scripts name is "mystart", you are in runlevel 3 and you have
made your script executable (chmod a+x mystart), and you have it
in your own home directory, then you do like this:

alien: ~$ cp mystart /etc/rc.d/init.d/
alien: ~$ cd /etc/rc.d/rc3.d
alien: /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/ $ ln -s ../init.d/mystart Z00mystart
alien: /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/ $

And that's all of that.

So now, what does the Z00 in Z00mystart or S85 in S85httpd mean ?
Well, as the system starts it will read file after file in it's runlevels
directory in alphabetical order, so to get them to start in a preticular
order, the link names are made to determen that order.
So the later in the alphabet the first character is the later it will boot,
and the same for for the number, the higher number the later it will start.

So A00something will start before A01something
And Z99something will start later then X99something and so on.

To get something to start at boot time you can also add it as a command
in the /etc/rc.d/rc.local (or for some systems /etc/rc.local) file.
That file is meant to be used for single commands and not to start up
major things like a server etc.

Always try to load things with the actual runlevel which is the more correct
way, rather then adding them to the rc.local file

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So what's the difference between the BSD init and the System V init ?
The only thing that differs them that you need to rememer is that they
store the startup scripts in different places.

The startup scripts for the BSD init is mainly in the following places:

/etc/rc0.d/
/etc/rc1.d/
/etc/rc2.d/
/etc/rc3.d/
/etc/rc4.d/
/etc/rc5.d/
/etc/rc6.d/
/etc/rc.boot/
/etc/rcS.d/
/etc/init.d/

While the Syst V init stores its scripts mainly in:

/etc/rc.d/rc0.d/
/etc/rc.d/rc1.d/
/etc/rc.d/rc2.d/
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/
/etc/rc.d/rc4.d/
/etc/rc.d/rc5.d/
/etc/rc.d/rc6.d/
/etc/rc.d/init.d/

In the BSD init the /etc/rc.boot/ and the /etc/rcS.d/ directorys
are more or less substitutes for the rc.local file since you can
put things in them that starts up at boot time...
what you put in /etc/rcS.d/ will even start at single user mode,
so be careful what you put there.

So basically, the actual scripts goes in the init.d directory
and you link them to the runlevel directory with a prefix to determen where
in the bootup they should be loaded.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is an example of how an init script can be made.
Here I made a script that would start a daemon named "daemon"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#!/bin/sh
# example	Example init script that would load 'daemon'
#
# Version:	@(#) /etc/rc.d/inet.d/example 0.01 19-Feb-2001
#
# Author:	Billy (Alien), <alien@ktv.koping.se>
#

. /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions	

function status() {
  ps aux | grep daemon &&
  echo "Daemon is running." ||
  echo "Daemon is not running."
}

case "$1" in
    start)
    # Check if daemon is in our path.
    if `which daemon` > /dev/null; then success || failure; fi
    echo -n "Starting Daemon"
	daemon
    echo
   ;;
    stop)
    # Check if daemon is in our path again.
    if `which daemon` > /dev/null; then success || failure; fi
    echo "Stopping Daemon"
	killall -15 daemon
   ;;
    status)
    echo "Status of Daemon:"
	status
   ;;
    reload)
    echo "Restarting Daemon."
	killall -1 daemon
   ;;
    restart)
    if `which echo` > /dev/null; then success || failure; fi
    $0 stop
    $0 start
   ;;
    *)
    echo "Usage: $0 start|stop|restart|status"
    exit 0
esac

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A note is that the success and failure functions/commands come from
the /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions file, which may not be present in all
distributions of Linux, since it as far as I know only comes with
RedHat and Mandrake.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The inits main configuration file is the /etc/inittab file, here is where
you set which runlevel you you wanna have, and how many consoles you want
etc, so here we go:

The line where you actually set the runlevel looks like this (here runlevel 3):

id:3:initdefault:

Most RedHat like systems have runlevel 3 or 5 as default, but if you don't
have any networking, you may find it better to change to runlevel 2.

Next in this file should be the system initialization.

si::sysinit:/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit

This line tells the system the path to the rc.sysinit where it loads
alot in the system, as system clock, sets the hostname, and
performs a number of checks.

Next in line is this:

l0:0:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 0
l1:1:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 1
l2:2:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 2
l3:3:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 3
l4:4:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 4
l5:5:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 5
l6:6:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 6

This tells the system where to load the programs and daemons it should load
for the runlevel it's in.
Say that we are in runlevel 3 (Default) then it looks at this line:

l3:3:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 3

And there after goes to load all what's in /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/
(rc3.d or any rc?.d contains links to the real files or scripts
that's located in /etc/rc.d/init.d, so if you wanna add something to
your runlevel, just look how they have done it and do it in a similar fashion.
and make sure to not start any network dependent application before the
network starts and so on...)

Then it comes some other various stuff as trap the Ctrl+Alt+Del etc.

After this comes the tty's (Terminal Types), and there locations.

1:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty1
2:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty2
3:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty3
4:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty4
5:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty5
6:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty6

If you wanna add some more you can add like this:

8:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty8
9:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty9
10:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty10
11:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty11

And leav tty7 reserved for X-windows.

Last in the file should only be some line about xdm and it's location,
this is if you have xdm installed...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And if you have read the tutorial to this point you shouldent need any real
explanation of this script.

If you still dont understand how the init scripts work, read the
scripts in your system and try to understand them.
And also read this section about the init and the init scripts again.

It's probably worth noting that with RedHat FC8 the file name in the rc.d/ directory should start with the letter S (ie. the example of starting the file with the letter Z would not work)
